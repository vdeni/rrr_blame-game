# Methods

## Study 1a

```{r s1a-data}
source(here::here('analyses',
                  'study_1a',
                  'wrangling',
                  'study_1a_prepare-analysis-data.R'))
```

In total, `r .d_s1a_nstart` people decided to participate in the study. As was
stated earlier, we have decided to exclude participants who have entered a
fine greater than or equal to `r .fine_lim_hrk` HRK. None of the
participants met the exclusion criterion. However, `r .d_s1a_nas`
participants were
excluded because they have not responded to questions regarding the assessment
of blame or the assessment of the fine. These exclusions left us
with `r nrow(d_s1a)` participants who have provided the data necessary for
the analysis. Of the `r nrow(d_s1a)` participants,
`r filter(d_s1a, experimental_situation == 'agentive') %>% nrow(.)` read the
agentive description of the event, and
`r filter(d_s1a, experimental_situation == 'nonagentive') %>% nrow(.)` read
the nonagentive description of the event.

```{r s1a-demo}
.gender <- table(d_s1a$gender)
```

The participants were students from the Faculty of Humanities and Social
Sciences of the University of Zagreb, Croatia. Of the `r nrow(d_s1a)`
participants whose data were analysed, `r .gender['woman']` declared themselves
as women, `r .gender['man']` as men, `r .gender['other']` chose "other", and
`r .gender['do not want to disclose']` chose not to disclose the information
(`r sum(is.na(d_s1a$gender))` participants left the question unanswered).
The median age of the participants whose data was analysed and who listed
their age was `r median(d_s1a$age, na.rm = T)` (with a range from
`r min(d_s1a$age, na.rm = T)` to `r max(d_s1a$age, na.rm = T)`;
N = `r sum(!is.na(d_s1a$age))`).

## Study 1b

```{r s1b-data}
source(here::here('analyses',
                  'study_1b',
                  'wrangling',
                  'study_1b_prepare-analysis-data.R'))
```

In total, `r .d_s1b_nstart` people decided to participate in the study. As was
stated earlier, we have decided to exclude participants who have entered a
fine greater than or equal to `r .fine_lim_usd` USD. One of the
participants met the exclusion criterion. Furthermore, `r .d_s1b_nas`
participants were
excluded because they have not responded to questions regarding the assessment
of blame or the assessment of the fine. These exclusions left us
with `r nrow(d_s1b)` participants who have provided the data necessary for
the analysis. Of the `r nrow(d_s1b)` participants,
`r filter(d_s1b, experimental_situation == 'agentive') %>% nrow(.)` read the
agentive description of the event, and
`r filter(d_s1b, experimental_situation == 'nonagentive') %>% nrow(.)` read
the nonagentive description of the event.

```{r s1b-demo}
.gender <- table(d_s1b$gender)
```

The participants were recruited through Prolific.
Of the `r nrow(d_s1b)`
participants whose data were analysed, `r .gender['Female']` declared themselves
as women, `r .gender['Male']` as men, and `r .gender['Other']` chose "other"
(`r sum(is.na(d_s1b$gender))` participant left the question unanswered).
The median age of the participants whose data was analysed and who listed
their age was `r median(d_s1b$age, na.rm = T)` (with a range from
`r min(d_s1b$age, na.rm = T)` to `r max(d_s1b$age, na.rm = T)`;
N = `r sum(!is.na(d_s1b$age))`).

## Study 2a

```{r s2a-data}
source(here('analyses',
            'study_2a',
            'wrangling',
            'study_2a_prepare-analysis-data.R'))
```

In total, `r .d_s2a_nstart` people decided to participate in this study. None
of the participants responded that the fine should be greater than or equal to
`r .fine_lim_hrk` HRK. However, `r .d_s2a_nas` participants did not state a
fine, and were therefore excluded. Furthermore, `r .d_s2a_partic_similar`
participants stated that they have recently participated in a similar study (or
have not answered to that question), and so were also excluded. This left us
with `r nrow(d_s2a)` participants.

```{r s2a-per-group}
.group_n <- d_s2a %>%
    count(.,
          agency,
          blame_level)
```

In total, `r filter(d_s2a, agency == 'agentive') %>% nrow(.)` participants read
the agentive description of the event. Of those,
`r filter(.group_n, agency == 'agentive') %>% glue::glue_data(.,
'{n} were assigned to blame level {blame_level}')`.
In total, `r filter(d_s2a, agency == 'nonagentive') %>% nrow(.)`
participants read the agentive description of the event. Of those,
`r filter(.group_n, agency == 'nonagentive') %>% glue::glue_data(.,
'{n} were assigned to blame level {blame_level}')`.

```{r s2a-demo}
.gender <- table(d_s2a$gender)
```

The participants were students from the University of Zagreb, Croatia, but not
students of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.
Of the `r nrow(d_s2a)`
participants whose data were analysed, `r .gender['female']` declared themselves
as women, `r .gender['male']` as men, `r .gender['other']` chose "other",
and `r .gender['I prefer not to answer']` stated that they prefer not to
answer(`r sum(is.na(d_s2a$gender))` participant left the question
unanswered).
The median age of the participants whose data was analysed and who listed
their age was `r median(d_s2a$age, na.rm = T)` (with a range from
`r min(d_s2a$age, na.rm = T)` to `r max(d_s2a$age, na.rm = T)`).

## Study 2b

```{r s2b-data}
source(here('analyses',
            'study_2b',
            'wrangling',
            'study_2b_prepare-analysis-data.R'))
```

In total, `r .d_s2b_nstart` people decided to participate in this study. Of
those, `r .d_s2b_ngthan` participants responded that the fine should be greater
than or equal to `r .fine_lim_usd` USD, and were therefore excluded.
Additionally, `r .d_s2b_nas` participants did not state a fine, and so were
excluded. This left us with `r nrow(d_s2b)` participants.

```{r s2b-per-group}
.group_n <- d_s2b %>%
    count(.,
          agency,
          blame_level)
```

In total, `r filter(d_s2b, agency == 'agentive') %>% nrow(.)` participants read
the agentive description of the event. Of those,
`r filter(.group_n, agency == 'agentive') %>% glue::glue_data(.,
'{n} were assigned to blame level {blame_level}')`.
In total, `r filter(d_s2b, agency == 'nonagentive') %>% nrow(.)`
participants read the agentive description of the event. Of those,
`r filter(.group_n, agency == 'nonagentive') %>% glue::glue_data(.,
'{n} were assigned to blame level {blame_level}')`.

```{r s2b-demo}
.gender <- table(d_s2b$gender)
```

The participants were recruited through Prolific.
Of the `r nrow(d_s2b)`
participants whose data were analysed, `r .gender['female']` declared themselves
as women, `r .gender['male']` as men, `r .gender['other']` chose "other",
and `r .gender['I prefer not to answer']` stated that they prefer not to answer
(`r sum(is.na(d_s2b$gender))` participant left the question unanswered).
The median age of the participants whose data was analysed and who listed
their age was `r median(d_s2b$age, na.rm = T)` (with a range from
`r min(d_s2b$age, na.rm = T)` to `r max(d_s2b$age, na.rm = T)`;
N = `r sum(!is.na(d_s2b$age))`).
